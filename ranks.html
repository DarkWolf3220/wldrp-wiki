Beta is usually the eldest son of the alpha pair, who has the best chance of becoming the dominant wolf after his father. His task is to take care of puppies, he is their best friend, he even spends more time with them than the alpha male. The alpha pair counts most with beta and allows him to eat right away. As the alpha pair passes by him, he lowers his head and balles his tail under him as he sees the dominant pair check to see if he obeys them. The beta male has a good chance of achieving full dominance over the other wolves in the group if he only defeats the dominant alpha male. The beta is also designed to check each new individual wishing to join the herd. After determining that the individual does not pose a threat, it accepts it into the pack.</td>

They are responsible for hunting, pack defense, alpha pair assistance and puppy training. They can also take over the pack temporarily when there are no pairs of Alpha and Beta wolves nearby, only adult individuals can do this. They rank higher than Delta wolves and omega wolves.</td>

This rank consists of elderly and respected wolves, the alpha couple's aunts and uncles, and younger wolves who want to prove their value to the pack.  They are the most likely to participate in group hunts and help care for the pups. They often work together to help the alpha female care for her wolf pup, teaching them how to hunt and survive in the wild. They also defend the pack from outsiders, go for patrols, and may take on other tasks depending on what is needed of them by the alpha and beta wolves at any given time.</td>

In relationships with other wolves, it shows submission. The omega is usually a wolf that has joined the pack, but does not belong to the alpha pair family or is old, and therefore too weak to be able to resist the attacks of other wolves.This wolves are often submissive towards the Alpha and Beta wolves but will take charge in their absence.</td>
